The NeoStats team is a group of IRC coders who aim to provide a
complete set of IRC Services for IRC networks. Currently, our 
prime software package is NeoStats, a expandable and extenable
set of IRC Services, that aim to provide more than just NickServ
and ChanServ (In Fact, as of now, (Sept 2002) there are no NickServ
or ChanServ features in NeoStats. although they are being developed)

The NeoStats team is commited to IRC software, and has been writting 
software for close to 4 years now. Anyone is welcome to join in our 
coding efforts by sending us Patches, or just helping out in our support
Boards or channels.
