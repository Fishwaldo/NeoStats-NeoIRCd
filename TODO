NeoStats HostServ should accept /privmsg hostserv login <username> <password> for NeoIRCD vhost support!

Does Glines get propogated to new servers that have just joined the network? I don't think so, but have to confirm.

SQlines etc need to be propogated

sendto_realops and sendto_realops_flags needs ability to send network wide (not just server wide)

update SERVER command, so Hidden, or Dynamic U-lined servers are introduced in a nicer way (Not via Server info line, as its done now)

SWHOIS support (I love it!)


POST 1.0
*Umode +b (Bots) to identify bots (iEf2002)
*it would be nice if we could pass message handlers the actuall command that triggered the handler
*Umode +a (Services Root) and +N (Network Admin)
*SSL Client Support (Still not sure how to do this)
*Implement servlink so it can either be a seperate process, or linked to the ircd. (for shells with a process limit, its baaaad)
