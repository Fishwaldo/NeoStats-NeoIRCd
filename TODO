NeoStats HostServ should accept /privmsg hostserv login <username> <password> for NeoIRCD vhost support!

Does Glines get propogated to new servers that have just joined the network? I don't think so, but have to confirm.

SQlines etc need to be propogated

/nickserv /chanserv etc need to be added (dynamically!)

sendto_realops and sendto_realops_flags needs ability to send network wide (not just server wide)

update SERVER command, so Hidden, or Dynamic U-lined servers are introduced in a nicer way (Not via Server info line, as its done now)
